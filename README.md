Fredit implement a prototype editing environment for fait resource files for code bubbles. It is
currently incomplete and only provides limited functionality.

It should be cloned or installed along with fait (and
faitbb and karma) before any of them is compiled.  While it can be compiled separately (run ant in the
top level or in any of the source directories), it is usually build by running ant at the top level of
fait which includes faitbb in the fait plugin.
